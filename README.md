# PearlHacks-2022
## Description
As women in a male-dominated area of study, we are passionate about advancing gender equality. However, for those who are not educated in the modern-day scope of diversity, it can be intimidating to try and promote change. Rather than allowing intimidation to incite submission, we wanted to create an enjoyable game with the purpose of educating others on some important topics and words.
